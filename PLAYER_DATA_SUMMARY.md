  - 10 years (2015-2024)
  - 5 years (2020-2024)
  - 3 years (2022-2024)
  - Current year (2024)
  - Last year (2023)

### **Rich Statcast Metrics Included**
- **Traditional Stats**: BA, OBP, SLG, wOBA, K%, BB%
- **Expected Stats**: xBA, xOBP, xSLG, xwOBA (predictive metrics)
- **Batted Ball Data**: Launch speed, launch angle, hard-hit %
- **Advanced Metrics**: Barrel rate, swing metrics, pitch movement
- **Pitcher Stuff**: Velocity, spin rate, whiff rates
- **Positioning Data**: Defensive positioning and movement

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Structure

### **New Tables Created**
1. **`savant_batting_stats`** - 79 columns of batting data
2. **`savant_pitching_stats`** - 79 columns of pitching data  
3. **`savant_data_sources`** - Tracking of imported files

### **Existing Tables (Preserved)**
- `teams` - Team information
- `team_hitting_stats` - Team batting by season
- `team_pitching_stats` - Team pitching by season
- `standings` - Team standings by season
- `collection_log` - Data collection tracking

## üîß Tools Created

### **1. Import System (`import_savant_csvs.py`)**
- Automated CSV import with data cleaning
- Handles multiple time periods
- Data integrity checks
- Comprehensive error handling

### **2. Database Analyzer (`fixed_mlb_analyzer.py`)**

- Performance summaries

## üìà Key Analytical Capabilities

### **Player Performance Analysis**
- **Breakout Candidates**: Players with xStats > actual stats (underperforming expectations)
- **Regression Candidates**: Players with actual stats > xStats (overperforming expectations)
- **Skill vs. Luck**: Separate sustainable performance from random variation

### **Betting Value Identification**
- **Expected vs. Actual Performance**: Find players due for positive/negative regression
- **Underlying Metrics**: Use Statcast data to predict future performance
- **Market Inefficiencies**: Identify where public perception differs from data

### **Advanced Scouting**
- **Pitcher Stuff Rankings**: Velocity, spin rate, whiff rates
- **Batted Ball Quality**: Hard-hit rate, barrel rate, launch conditions
- **Plate Discipline**: Walk/strikeout rates, swing decisions

## üéØ Sample Insights Generated

### **Top Performers (10-Year wOBA)**
1. Aaron Judge: 0.487 wOBA
2. Shohei Ohtani: 0.448 wOBA
3. Ronald Acu√±a Jr.: 0.396 wOBA

### **Breakout Candidates (3-Year)**
1. Juan Soto: +0.062 wOBA upside (xwOBA > wOBA)
2. Austin Slater: +0.061 wOBA upside
3. Sean Murphy: +0.060 wOBA upside

### **Top Pitchers (K%)**
1. Garrett Crochet: 28.1% strikeout rate
2. Cole Ragans: 27.9% strikeout rate
3. Tarik Skubal: 26.8% strikeout rate

## üöÄ Next Steps & Applications

### **For Sports Betting**
1. **Player Props**: Use xStats to identify over/under value
2. **Team Totals**: Aggregate player metrics for team performance
3. **Matchup Analysis**: Pitcher vs. batter historical data
4. **Injury Impact**: Identify key players affecting team performance

### **Advanced Analytics**

## üèÜ Conclusion

Your MLB database now contains one of the most comprehensive collections of player-level statistics available, combining traditional team data with cutting-edge Statcast player metrics. This positions you to identify betting opportunities that others might miss by providing deeper insights into player performance, expected outcomes, and market inefficiencies.

The integration of expected statistics (xBA, xwOBA, etc.) is particularly powerful for sports betting, as these metrics often predict future performance better than traditional stats, giving you a significant analytical edge.
